Welcome to Biztory's example dataset to be used with a free Snowflake and DBT Trial.
Ideally, used alongside Fivetran we've put this together as a demo to show you how easy it is to combine your data from several sources, modelling them into a Kimball data warehouse and produce an end result view to be published in Tableau!

### Using the starter project

- Signup for a free Snowflake account: https://signup.snowflake.com/
- Import the data using the SQL script found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10LL5xrng081aRnZEz4OBmQyLIXWDXRQO/view?usp=sharing)
- Create a free dbt account: https://cloud.getdbt.com/signup/
- Download this repo and upload into a new git repository
- Link your DBT user with your git account
- When complete, do dbt run to run all the scripts
- Your data is good to go in Snowflake and ready to use in Tableau
- You then have a free trial of Snowflake, DBT and some dummy data to play around with
